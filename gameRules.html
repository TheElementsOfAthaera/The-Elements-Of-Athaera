                        However, we don't think that it makes very much sense to charge players for the rules of the

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to The Elements of Athaera! This rulebook is designed to help new players understand the
                    basics of the game and get started on their journey to becoming a master strategist. Whether you're
                    a seasoned card game player or new to the genre, this guide will provide you with the information
                    you need to enjoy The Elements of Athaera.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In this card game you will use your <span>Unit</span>, <span>Source</span>, and <span>Utility</span>
                    cards to defend your castle while simultaneously trying to reduce your opponent(s) castle to rubble.
                    Each castle has its own <span>Renown</span> and every battling player starts with <span>50
                        Renown</span>. <span>The first player to reduce their opponent's Renown to 0 wins the
                        game!</span>
                </p>

                        <span>The maximum number of cards with the same name in your deck is 3</span>.

                    </li>
                    <li><span><strong>-Support Deck: </strong></span>A support deck is a group of <span>up to 20
                            cards</span> that will not be placed on the game field, but will be reserved by you in order
                        to <span>swap out cards from your Main or Support deck at a 1:1 ratio between match

                    <li><span><strong>-Counters: </strong></span>You may often find the need to count the amount of
                        something on the field, such as <span>Essence</span>. Anything will work as long as its used too
                        keep count and ins't obstructing other players or yourself!</li>
                    <li><span><strong>-Pen, Paper, Calculator: </strong></span>This isn't necessary to play the game,
                        although keeping track of your Unit health and Renown is the best way to know who wins or loses
